The reason why you should use this instead of other templates, is because it is unique. Maybe you arent a website type of coder, but you are amazing with javascript and python. With this, you can add a twist to that! It looks just like a console, and it works like a console!

# Ease of Use

Very easy to use, the only thing you need to edit is the `data.js` file. Below it will show you how to edit it, if you dont know how to :)
